# Baseball Poisson Regression
Part of final project for Regression Analysis (ISyE 6414) at Georgia Tech.

The aim of this part of the final project was to develop two poisson regressions to predict runs scored and runs allowed using batting and pitching statistics respectively. These models were then used to predict run differential and game outcomes for a subset of the 2023 season.
